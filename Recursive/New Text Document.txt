Initial Setup:

    permList is an array to store the current permutation.
    permSize is initially set to 0.
    nameList contains the names "A", "B", and "C".
    nameSize is 3.

Initial Call:


PrintAllPermutations(permList, 0, nameList, 3);

The function is called to generate permutations starting from an empty permutation (permList) and considering all names in nameList.

First Iteration (i = 0):

    swap(&nameList[0], &nameList[0]) does nothing as it's swapping the element with itself.
    permList[0] = nameList[0] sets the first element of the current permutation to "A".
    The function is then called recursively with PrintAllPermutations(permList, 1, nameList, 3).

Second Iteration (i = 1):

    swap(&nameList[1], &nameList[1]) does nothing.
    permList[1] = nameList[1] sets the second element of the current permutation to "B".
    Recursive call: PrintAllPermutations(permList, 2, nameList, 3).

Third Iteration (i = 2):

    swap(&nameList[2], &nameList[2]) does nothing.
    permList[2] = nameList[2] sets the third element of the current permutation to "C".
    Recursive call: PrintAllPermutations(permList, 3, nameList, 3).

Base Case (permSize == nameSize):

    Since permSize is now equal to nameSize (3), it prints the current permutation: "A, B, C".

Backtracking:

    The function returns to the previous level (permSize = 2).
    The loop continues to the next iteration (i = 2), but there are no more elements left, so it proceeds to backtrack again.

Backtracking (permSize = 1):

    The function returns to the previous level (permSize = 1).
    It increments i to 2, and the loop continues with the next iteration.

Second Iteration (i = 2):

    The process repeats with the second permutation: "A, C, B".
    After printing this permutation, the function backtracks again.

Backtracking (permSize = 0):

    The function returns to the initial level (permSize = 0).
    It increments i to 1, and the loop continues.

Third Iteration (i = 1):

    The process repeats with the third permutation: "B, A, C".
    After printing this permutation, the function backtracks again.

Backtracking (permSize = 0):

    The function returns to the initial level (permSize = 0).
    It increments i to 2, and the loop continues.

Fourth Iteration (i = 2):

    The process repeats with the fourth permutation: "B, C, A".
    After printing this permutation, the function backtracks again.

Backtracking (permSize = 0):

    The function returns to the initial level (permSize = 0).
    It increments i to 3, but there are no more elements left in the loop.

End of Function:

    The function exits, and all permutations have been generated and printed.

So, the output for the input "3 A B C" would be:

A, B, C
A, C, B
B, A, C
B, C, A
C, B, A
C, A, B
Each line corresponds to a unique permutation of the input names.
