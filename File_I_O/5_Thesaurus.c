/*
Given a set of text files containing synonyms for different words, complete the main program to output the synonyms for a specific word. Each text file contains synonyms for the word specified in the fileâ€™s name, and the synonyms within the file are grouped according to the synonyms' first letters, separated by an '*'. The program reads a word and a letter from the user and opens the text file associated with the input word. The program then stores the contents of the text file into a two-dimensional array of char* predefined in the program. Finally the program searches the array and outputs all the synonyms that begin with the input letter, one synonym per line, or a message if no synonyms that begin with the input letter are found.

Hints: Use the malloc() function to allocate memory for each of the synonyms stored in the array. A string always ends with a null character ('\0'). Use ASCII values to map the row index of the array to the first letter of a word when storing the synonyms into the array. Ex: Index 0 to an 'a', index 25 to a 'z'. Assume all letters are in lowercase.

Ex: If the input of the program is:

educate c

the program opens the file educate.txt, which contains:

brainwash
brief
*
civilize
coach
cultivate
*
develop
discipline
drill
*
edify
enlighten
exercise
explain
*
foster
*
improve
indoctrinate
inform
instruct
*
mature
*
nurture
*
rear
*
school
*
train
tutor
*

then the program outputs:

civilize
coach
cultivate

Ex: If the input of the program is:

educate a

then the program outputs:

No synonyms for educate begin with a.
